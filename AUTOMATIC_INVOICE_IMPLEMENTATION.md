# Automatic Invoice Generation Implementation

## Overview
The automatic invoice generation feature has been successfully implemented in the PawssibleSolutions veterinary management system. This feature automatically creates invoices with predefined pricing when appointments are marked as "completed".

## Service Pricing Structure
The following service prices are now automatically applied when creating invoices:

| Service | Price (₱) |
|---------|-----------|
| Wellness Exam | 500.00 |
| Vaccination | 500.00 |
| Sick Visit | 1,000.00 |
| Injury | 2,000.00 |
| Dental Care | 500.00 |
| Surgery Consultation | 700.00 |
| Follow-up Visit | 300.00 |

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created

1. **`includes/service_price_mapper.php`** (NEW)
   - Contains the `ServicePriceMapper` class
   - Handles service price mapping and automatic invoice generation
   - Methods:
     - `getServicePrice($service)` - Returns price for a given service
     - `createInvoiceItem($service)` - Creates invoice item structure
     - `autoGenerateInvoice($db, $appointment_id)` - Generates complete invoice

2. **`admin/update_status.php`** (MODIFIED)
   - Added automatic invoice generation when appointment status changes to "completed"
   - Only triggers if appointment wasn't already completed
   - Includes error handling to not fail status update if invoice generation fails

3. **`vet/view_appointment.php`** (MODIFIED)
   - Added automatic invoice generation for vet status updates
   - Triggers when vet marks appointment as completed
   - Provides user feedback about invoice generation

4. **`vet/add_medical_record.php`** (MODIFIED)
   - Added automatic invoice generation when medical record creation marks appointment as completed
   - Ensures seamless workflow from medical record to invoice

5. **`test_auto_invoice.php`** (NEW)
   - Test script to verify automatic invoice generation functionality
   - Tests service pricing, invoice item creation, and full invoice generation

## How It Works

### Trigger Points
The automatic invoice generation is triggered when:
1. Admin updates appointment status to "completed" via `admin/update_status.php`
2. Vet updates appointment status to "completed" via `vet/view_appointment.php`
3. Vet adds a medical record which automatically marks appointment as "completed"

### Process Flow
1. **Status Change Detection**: System detects when appointment status changes to "completed"
2. **Service Price Lookup**: Uses the appointment's "reason" field to determine service type
3. **Price Mapping**: Maps service to predefined price using `ServicePriceMapper::getServicePrice()`
4. **Invoice Creation**: Creates invoice record in `invoices` table
5. **Invoice Item Creation**: Creates corresponding item in `invoice_items` table
6. **Error Handling**: Any errors in invoice generation are logged but don't prevent status update

### Database Tables Involved
- `appointments` - Source of service information and client details
- `invoices` - Main invoice records
- `invoice_items` - Individual line items for invoices

## Safety Features

### Duplicate Prevention
- System checks if invoice already exists for an appointment before creating a new one
- Returns existing invoice ID if found

### Error Handling
- Invoice generation errors are logged but don't prevent appointment status updates
- User receives notification if invoice generation fails
- Database transactions ensure data consistency

### Validation
- Only completed appointments trigger invoice generation
- Validates appointment exists and belongs to correct vet (for vet actions)
- Ensures required data is available before proceeding

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Create an appointment with reason "Wellness Exam"
2. Mark appointment as "completed" through admin or vet interface
3. Verify invoice is automatically created with ₱500.00 amount
4. Check that invoice contains correct client and appointment information

### Test Script
Run `test_auto_invoice.php` to:
- Verify service pricing configuration
- Test invoice item creation
- Test full invoice generation process
- Display detailed results and error information

## Benefits

### For Staff
- Eliminates manual invoice creation step
- Reduces data entry errors
- Ensures consistent pricing
- Streamlines workflow from appointment completion to billing

### For Management
- Standardized pricing across all services
- Automatic revenue tracking
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Better financial reporting accuracy

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Dynamic Pricing**: Allow admin to modify service prices through interface
2. **Multiple Services**: Support appointments with multiple services
3. **Discounts**: Add support for discounts and promotional pricing
4. **Tax Calculation**: Automatic tax calculation and inclusion
5. **Payment Terms**: Configurable payment terms and due dates

### Configuration Options
- Service price management interface
- Enable/disable automatic invoice generation
- Custom invoice templates
- Notification settings for generated invoices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Invoice not generated**: Check if appointment reason matches predefined services
2. **Duplicate invoices**: System prevents this automatically
3. **Pricing errors**: Verify service names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Logging
All invoice generation errors are logged to PHP error log with format:
```
Invoice generation failed for appointment {ID}: {Error Message}
```

### Support
For issues or modifications, check:
- `includes/service_price_mapper.php` for pricing logic
- Database `invoices` and `invoice_items` tables for data issues
- PHP error logs for detailed error information

## Conclusion
The automatic invoice generation feature provides a seamless integration between appointment completion and billing, ensuring accurate and timely invoice creation while maintaining system reliability and data integrity.
